## About

Eventrix is a straightforward HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based webpage designed to list and display events. It aims to provide a clean and responsive interface for users to easily browse upcoming events. This project is ideal for small organizations or individuals looking for a simple, no-frills solution to showcase their events online.

The webpage is built using basic HTML structure, styled with CSS for visual appeal and responsiveness, and may include minimal JavaScript for interactive elements (if any). The target audience includes event organizers, small businesses, and community groups who need a simple, easily maintainable website to list events.

Key technologies used include HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and potentially JavaScript for basic interactivity. The architecture is simple: a single HTML page linked to CSS and JavaScript files. The unique selling point is its simplicity and ease of deployment, requiring no backend or complex setup.
